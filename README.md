## Compile and run

#### Dependencies

- `UNIX` - access to Unix-like operating system commands (find, rm, etc.). WSL works fine on Windows.
- `Make` - for building the source code.
- `cc` - a C11 compiler. Tested with GCC. Clang should work, altough you would have to modify the `Makefile` and `tests/run.sh`.

#### Optional dependencies for further development
- `python`, `clang-format` - for formatting the source code.
- `bear` - a tool for generating compiler commands for C compilers. 
- `valgrind` - a tool for finding memory leaks and other undefined behavior. Used in `tests/run.sh`


```sh
$ make
```

```sh
$ ./gigaduf
```

Voila.

## Usage
- `make` - compiles the source code.
- `make debug` - compiles the source with the `-g` and `-DDEBUG` options.
- `make debug-verbose` - fancy printf debugging :-)
- `make clean` - not dirty.
- `make bear` - generates a file of the compiler options.
- `make format` - makes the code objectively pretty.
